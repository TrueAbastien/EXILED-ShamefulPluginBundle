# EXILED-ShamefulPluginBundle
Bundle of all created Plugins for EXILED - SCP:SL Library for External Development

***

This Bundle contains the following self-made plugins:
* [**Tournament**](https://github.com/TrueAbastien/EXILED-ShamefulPluginBundle/tree/Tournament): create a tournament event where, 2 by 2, dboys fight to their death until only one remains.
* [**Horcrux**](https://github.com/TrueAbastien/EXILED-ShamefulPluginBundle/tree/Horcrux): a class role is given abilities for every player of another specified class role.
* [**ShakyGrowth**](https://github.com/TrueAbastien/EXILED-ShamefulPluginBundle/tree/ShakyGrowth): a stupidly simple plugin where every damage afflicted triggers a size change on the victim.
* [**CharacterTraits**](https://github.com/TrueAbastien/EXILED-ShamefulPluginBundle/tree/CharacterTraits): every non-scp player will spawn with random traits giving them specifics advantages/abilities.

***

All of the previous plugins are stored on this Github repository (which might not be the most efficient way but I'm not here to care about your feelings, so deal with it).
